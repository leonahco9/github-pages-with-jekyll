As you know, my name is Leona Jain.

One thing I am proud of is my ability to keep straight A's throughout my entire high school experience so far. I have worked very hard for this every single day,
so having it pay off is very rewarding. Another thing I am proud of is being the Championship winner of my business summer program. This means a lot of me 
because I plan to enter the business/economics field in college, so having a success in this categroy feels good. The third thing I am proud of is my nonprofit organization that I have created. It is called "Books for the Better" and it focuses on collecitng books that we donate to homeless shelters. 

Some of my interests are cooking, baking, and running. I am a CPR certified and have experience using Microsoft Excel and Java. Some of my job experience is 
being a lifeguard at Crystal Springs Waterpark. I also worked at Panera Bread as a Services Ambassador.
